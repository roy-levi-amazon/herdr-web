  [PR #16](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/16)

### Changed

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-18

### Added

### Changed

- Coalesced fast terminal output bursts in the bridge before forwarding them to browser clients,

  redraws; concepts derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork.
  [PR #14](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/14)
- Reworked Settings into Bridge, Terminal, and Mobile areas, with horizontal area tabs on narrow
  screens. [PR #12](https://github.com/kcosr/herdr-web/pull/12)
- Improved browser startup by lazy-loading the terminal renderer with retry after load failures,
  adding installable mobile web app metadata and raster icons, and compressing static
  bridge-served web assets; concepts derived from the @roy-levi-amazon fork.
